  <h1>The Updated plan</h1>
  <p>After trying and many attempts failing i think i got finished with mostly in the way i needed to do, but i found out that things where not as easy as i thought. Task 2 and 3 mostly where like i thought it to be.
     I learned from the lectures and presented out like that with the split options and making the 2D array to be created after reading the file out of the fileReader function. We have learned alot about this in lectures, so this was not
     something i thought would be the hardest to do. The thing i would be afraid off is that i dont understand everything 100%, so i was unsure if i would make myself understand what i did. I still think i need to read alot about
     2D array and how it takes the file and make an array out of it. I just know that by making an array reading the file and split into new lines and further split into spaces.     
  </p>

  <p> Further on in task 4, 5 and 6 i stumbled on the most difficult in task 4 and task 6. In task 4 i new i had to bring the array further with main(array) and go into the arrays fields and collect the data i needed to make the statistics.
     I didnt use math on any of the things. i Used loops for most and in max and min i said that if it was higher and lower than the arrays field when i set min and max as 0 and infinity it produced out the max amount of the field column and the min amount.
     To calculate the locations and types i did the same just changing the field as types are field nr 1 and locations are field nr 2. Calculating days was the hardest thing i did and i still dont understand most of what i did, but i mostly used 
     google to find out what i needed to do to present it. I needed to use push to push the array into the field i needed to calculate the outcome. I made a first and last to find the last and first date that the plan happend.
     I found the first by just counting the field and the last by using the lenght of the array and -1. Then to get everything in nr for the days i needed to divid the calculation on number of milliseconds in a day. 
     This was some of the things that maid me use mutch time to figure things out and i still dont know why i can do it this way, but i think that will come with time and try this out more because this is the first time i did this.
     Task 5 was just like i thought and made the table out of the things we learned in class by using creatElement and appendChild to get rows and columns. I thought i could do this in task 6 as well, but that was not as easy. It ended by that i didnt find out how to do it, 
     so i just printed out the statistics i got from the functions and into each cell in the table. I dont like i had to do this way, but it was the only way i knew.     
  </p>
<p> I am proud of what i have made out, but offcourse i think with more learning and time things will be better and i think in the future something like this will be easier to make and maybe find other solutions that will make everything easier to do.</p>
