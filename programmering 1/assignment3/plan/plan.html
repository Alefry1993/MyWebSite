  <h1>The plan</h1>
  <p>To start out this task i started by thinking of how ive was going to write the code to recieve the output that i wanted. Im not the perfect expert in 
    programming, so i used a long time to figure things out. First was task 2 that i start putting together an HTML file with an input field with the type "file". When i come to JS i started to use the FileReader 
    codes to get the input field in HTML to work and get the oppertunity to upload the csv file we where going to read from and then upload it into an 2D array. I wasn`t quiet sure how to go with it but tried out many different ways
    before i found out.   
  </p>
  <p>Task 3: When i got to this task i needed to get everything in the array and that will help me easier get the statistics into an tabell later on. I learned a little in the lections i thought i can use, so i will try that out. 
     Im not sure, but i think i have to use split the array i make two times where one is for next line and one to make the space between and further on to let it be ready for tabel inputting. </p>
  <p> Task 4: Getting the statistics in place was the thing i figured i will use the most time on. I would probably make a function for each statistic and use math for max amount and min amount.
       For the locations and types i will try to make it loop through to find each different in the array of that column, but not sure how just yet. Just have to try things out.  </p>
  <p> Task 5: This task i knew what i had to do after i learned it from the lectures. I needed to make nested loops where each loop would create each part of the table. 
      I used a loop to create first array[x] and createElement to make the rows for the table. Then i looped in the loop to make the columns and cells for the table.
      In the second loop i still createElement, but used appendChild to connect the rows with cells and columns. 
  </p>
  <p>Task 6: I Want to try and make the same option here like in task 5, but i will think its harder, but i am gonna try my best to make it happend. I would think its mostly the same as task 5
    just that i have to loop through with array fields and not the whole array element.
  </p>
